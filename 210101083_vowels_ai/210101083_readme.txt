How to Run the Code:

1. Move to the last line of the main function, and press F9 key to mark it as the break point.
2. Press F7 key to build the solution and F5 key to start debugging the code.
3. The terminal will print "Ai values are computed and stored in '210101083_ai_test.txt'." on successful execution of the code.


Output generated by the Code:

# 210101083_ai_test.txt - Stores the Ai's computed for the input file named 'test.txt'. It will match the values in 'dump_Ai_test.txt'.


Overview:

- This program processes vowel sound samples by computing autocorrelation and Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coefficients. 
- The program reads audio samples from a file, normalizes the data, computes the coefficients using Durbin's algorithm, and then writes the LPC coefficients to an output file. 
- This process helps in analyzing the characteristics of vowel sounds for further speech processing tasks.


Function Descriptions:

1. main(int argc, _TCHAR argv[])* -

	The main function orchestrates the processing of the vowel sound sample by: 
		- Specifying the input file containing vowel sound samples. 
		- Specifying the output file for storing LPC coefficients. 
		- Calling the ProcessVowel function to compute the required coefficients. 
		- Informing the user about the completion of the process.

2. ProcessVowel(const char filename, const char ai_filename) -

	- Processes the vowel sound samples from the specified file.
	- Reads 320 sample values from the input file.
	- Performs DC shift correction and normalization of the sample data.
	- Computes autocorrelation coefficients (R_i) using the Compute_Ri function.
	- Computes LPC coefficients (A_i) using the Compute_Ai function.
	- Writes the LPC coefficients to the specified output file.

3. Compute_Ri(double sample_data, double R_ref) -

	- Computes autocorrelation coefficients (R_i) for the given sample data.
	- Iterates through lags from 0 to 12 and calculates the sum of products of the sample data at each lag.
	- Returns the array of autocorrelation coefficients for further processing.

4. Compute_Ai(double A_ref, double R) -

	- Computes Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) coefficients (A_i) using Durbin's algorithm.
	- Uses the autocorrelation coefficients (R_i) to calculate reflection coefficients and prediction error energies.
	- Returns the LPC coefficients, which are used to model the vocal tract and analyze vowel characteristics.
